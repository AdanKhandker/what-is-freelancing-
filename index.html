       	    	<p>
       	    		You may be wondering, <b>“so what is freelancing?”</b> As a freelancer, you operate your own business rather than being employed by someone else. Freelancers are the self-employed and are often called independent contractors. A freelancer is hired by another company on a part-time basis or for a short-term project, but they do not receive the same compensation as full-time employees or have the same level of commitment.
       	    	</p>

       	    	<p> With the rise of the gig-economy, people are talking about freelancing more than ever before. And that’s because there are more freelancers today than there have ever been in history – a 2019 study by Upwork and Freelancers Union shows that 57 million Americans freelanced in 2019. And according to the same study, 53% of workers aged 18-22 are freelancing.</p>

       	    	<h1>Other terms for freelancing</h1>

       	    	<p>Not everyone uses the term <b>“freelance” or “freelancer”</b> when it comes to work that a freelancer may do. In fact, even most freelancers refer to themselves as “self-employed.” So other terms you may want to be aware of that relate to freelancing include:</p>



       	    	<ul>
       	    		<li><strong>Contract work:</strong> Jobs where you are working to fulfill a short-term or part time contract
       	    		</li>
       	    		<li>
       	    			<strong>Contract job:</strong>Contract job: Same as above.
       	    		</li>
       	    		<li>
       	    			<strong>Independent contractor:</strong> This is the IRS classification of a freelancer
       	    		</li>
       	    		<li>
       	    			<strong>1099:</strong> Freelancers are paid using a tax form called a “1099-MISC” as opposed to your typical, full-time W2. Sometimes “1099” is used to refer to a freelancer.
       	    		</li>
       	    		<li>
       	    			<strong>Contract consultant:</strong> This term refers to a consultant coming in under a 1099 contract for a short period of time.
       	    		</li>
       	    		<li>
       	    			<strong>Contract-to-hire</strong>: Sometimes freelancers are interested in full-time employment. Contract-to-hire roles provide a sort of “test period” for a freelancer before they are hired full time.
       	    		</li>

       	    	</ul>

       	    

       	    	<h1>Why is it called freelancing?</h1>
       	    	<p>Freelancers were medieval mercenaries who fought for whichever nation or person paid them the most during the 1800s. As you may know, the term "lance" referred to the long weapon used by knights on their horses to knock down their opponents (think of jousting).</p>

       	    	<br>



       	    	<h1>How does freelancing Work</h1>

       	    	<p>Freelancers accept payment in exchange for providing a service. An agreement of this type is usually short-term or part-time.For instance, if I hired a photographer to take new headshots for me, I could pay a freelancer for the session and that would be it.Freelancers are sometimes paid by the number of hours they work per week or per month they work. The arrangement is known as a "retainer." </p> 

       	    	<p>Retainers are when you retain the right to someone's time or services. There are many legal professionals who work on retainer. Every month, the client is billed for a certain amount of time, regardless of whether the time is utilized or not.It's one of the simplest and purest forms of entrepreneurship: the freelancer provides a specific service or outcome, and the buyer pays them directly.

       	    	<h1>Why are people freelancing?</h1>

       	    	<p>Individuals who freelance have a lot of flexibility and control. A freelancer typically chooses their own work hours, the clients they work with, and their own schedules. Some of them can work from home. Freelancing is also a form of entrepreneurship, which means the freelancer has total control over their earnings. Freelancers do not receive a salary, so they are able to charge their clients as much as they like. As a freelancer, you are your own boss.</p>

       	    	<p>As a freelancer, you have a lot of options for what kind of work you do. You can explore a wide variety of projects and industries by freelancing if you have a lot of interests and are drawn to new experiences. Freelancing isn't something that people tend to do forever, historically. They either hire other freelancers or hire employees to build a full-service agency, they build their own products to replace their freelance income, or they go back to work full-time.</p>

       	    	<p> <i> <strong>''Freelancing provides the flexibility many people seek when planning their next career move''.</strong></i></p>

       	    	Transcription services may only make $5-10 per hour, while software engineers may make $75 or more per hour. If you wish to ascertain how much income you can expect as a freelancer, you should compare rates of freelancers with your skillset.</i></p>

This freelance website provides a streamlined method for both freelancers and business owners to interact with one another. Note that on the website, freelancers are called <span>sellers</span>, their services – <span>gigs</span>, and business owners – <span>buyers.</span> </p>


       	    	<p>Instead of sending out bids, sellers can sign up for free, list their gigs, and set their prices. Meanwhile, buyers can simply browse through different categories to purchase. </p>

       	    	<p>Whenever a buyer purchases a gig, the system automatically charges their account and puts the money on hold. The system will then take a commission fee and send freelancers <span>80% </span>of the offered price.</p>
       	    	<p> Depending on each freelancer’s <span>seller level</span> , it can take up to <span>14 days</span> to withdraw their earnings. There are multiple options to withdraw the payments, such as <span>debit card, PayPal, and wire transfer.</span> </p></i>
